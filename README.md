## Overview

This system replaces manual logging with a fast, accurate QR-based process. Any staff member who needs to borrow a laptop, tablet, or other IT device can do so in seconds by scanning two QR codes — their employee ID and the device sticker. IT staff always have a real-time view of every device's status and location.

## Requirements

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) (Apache + MySQL + PHP 8.0+)
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Camera access (for QR scanning on the Borrow / Return and Login pages)

---

## Installation

**1. Clone or extract the project**

Place the `inventory` folder inside your XAMPP web root:

```
C:/xampp/htdocs/inventory/
```

**2. Enable mod_rewrite in Apache**

Open `C:/xampp/apache/conf/httpd.conf` and make these two changes:

Uncomment the rewrite module (remove the `#`):

```apache
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
```

Find the `<Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs">` block and change:

```apache
AllowOverride None
```

to:

```apache
AllowOverride All
```

Restart Apache in the XAMPP Control Panel after saving.

**3. Set up the database**

See [Database Setup](#database-setup) below.

**4. Open the app**

```
http://localhost/inventory/public
```

---

## Database Setup

**1. Open phpMyAdmin**

```
http://localhost/phpmyadmin
```

**2. Create the database**

Click **New** in the left sidebar, name it `inventory_db`, set collation to `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, and click **Create**.

**3. Import the schema and seed data**

- Select `inventory_db` from the sidebar
- Click the **Import** tab
- Click **Choose File** and select `storage/inventory.sql`
- Click **Go**

This creates all tables and loads the employee registry, device inventory, and any initial data included in the SQL file.

**4. Verify the database config**

Open `config/database.php` and confirm the credentials match your XAMPP setup:

```php
return [
    'host'     => '127.0.0.1',
    'database' => 'inventory_db',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '',        // XAMPP default is no password
];
```

**5. Clear audit data before going live (optional)**

If the SQL file contains demo transaction or reconciliation records, clear them in phpMyAdmin before first use:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE reconciliations;
TRUNCATE TABLE transactions;
```

`reconciliations` must go first. This resets the audit log, active borrow counts, and dashboard figures to zero without touching employee or device records.

## User Roles

| Role         | Access                                                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**    | Full access — manages devices and employees, views all reports, exports data, sees QR codes, views Activity Log |
| **IT Staff** | Facilitates borrow/return transactions, manages devices and locations, views employee list (QR codes hidden) |
| **Borrower** | Can scan their own ID to borrow or return equipment independently; sees personal borrow history via My Borrows |

---

## How It Works

### Borrowing a Device

1. Go to **Borrow / Return** and select **Borrow**
2. The camera opens — hold up the **employee ID card** QR code
3. Once detected, hold up the **device sticker** QR code
4. Fill in the **purpose of borrowing** and **expected return date** (or mark as indefinite)
5. Press **Confirm Borrow** — device is marked as **Borrowed**

### Returning a Device

1. Go to **Borrow / Return** and select **Return**
2. Scan the **employee ID** (original borrower or any staff member)
3. Scan the **device** QR code
4. System confirms return and displays the device's **designated shelf location**

If the person returning is different from the original borrower, the system records both — this is a **proxy return** and is fully logged in the audit trail.

### Overdue Devices

Any device with an expected return date that has passed is automatically flagged. The dashboard shows an **Overdue** count, and affected rows are highlighted in the active borrows table. Devices marked as indefinite are never flagged.

### Manual Reconciliation

IT staff can override a device's status at any time during a physical inventory check. Every override requires a written reason and is permanently logged with the staff member's name and timestamp. Use the **Reconcile** button on the Devices page.

> **Note:** To mark a device as Borrowed, always use the Borrow / Return scan page. The Edit device form only allows switching between **Available** and **Out of Service** — this keeps transaction records accurate.

---

## Maintenance

The **Maintenance** page (accessible to Admin and IT Staff) manages the list of valid storage locations — cabinet and shelf combinations — that appear as dropdowns when adding or editing a device.

### Adding a Location

1. Go to **Maintenance** in the sidebar
2. Click **+ Add Location**
3. Enter the cabinet name (e.g. `Cabinet A`) and shelf or section name (e.g. `Shelf 1`)
4. Click **Add Location** — it appears in the table immediately and becomes available in the device form dropdowns

### Removing a Location

1. Go to **Maintenance**
2. Find the location you want to remove — the **Devices Assigned** column shows how many devices currently use it
3. If the count is zero, click **Remove** and confirm
4. If the count is non-zero, the Remove button is disabled — reassign those devices to a different location first (via **Devices → Edit**), then return to Maintenance to remove it

> **Note:** Removing a location does not affect device records — cabinet and shelf values are stored as plain text on each device. Removing a location only prevents it from appearing in the dropdown going forward.

### First-Time Setup (existing installs only)

If the app was already running before the Maintenance feature was added, run this once in phpMyAdmin → `inventory_db` → **SQL** tab:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS locations (
    id         INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    cabinet    VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
    shelf      VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE KEY uq_location (cabinet, shelf)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

INSERT IGNORE INTO locations (cabinet, shelf) VALUES
('Cabinet A', 'Shelf 1'),
('Cabinet A', 'Shelf 2'),
('Cabinet A', 'Shelf 3'),
('Cabinet B', 'Shelf 1'),
('Cabinet B', 'Shelf 2'),
('Cabinet C', 'Shelf 1'),
('Cabinet C', 'Shelf 2'),
('Cabinet C', 'Shelf 3'),
('Cabinet 1', 'CBMS 1A'),
('Cabinet 1', 'CBMS 1B'),
('Cabinet 1', 'CBMS 1C'),
('Cabinet 1', 'CBMS 1D'),
('Cabinet 2', 'CBMS 2A'),
('Cabinet 2', 'CBMS 2B');
```

This is also saved as `storage/migration_add_locations.sql` if you prefer to use the Import tab instead. Fresh installs using `storage/inventory.sql` get the table automatically.

### Changing a Location Name

There is no rename function. To rename a location (e.g. `Cabinet A` → `Storage Room 1`):

1. Edit each device assigned to the old location and select the new one
2. Once the old location's device count reaches zero, remove it from Maintenance
3. Add the new location name if it does not already exist

---

## Activity Log

The **Activity Log** page (accessible to Admin only) provides a unified, actor-centric record of every significant action taken in the system — separate from the device and employee audit logs, which are device/borrower-centric.

### What is recorded

| Category   | Actions logged |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| **auth**     | Sign in, sign out |
| **employee** | Employee added; employee updated; role changed (old → new role shown explicitly) |
| **device**   | Device added; device updated; bulk status change; manual reconciliation |
| **location** | Location added; location removed |
| **scan**     | Device borrowed (self-serve or facilitated); device returned (direct or proxy) |
| **audit**    | Equipment or employee CSV exported |
| **device**   | QR codes printed or downloaded as PDF |

### Filtering

The page supports filtering by user, category, and date range — all client-side, no page reload.

### First-Time Setup (existing installs only)

If the app was already running before the Activity Log was added, run this once in phpMyAdmin → `inventory_db` → **SQL** tab:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `activity_log` (
    `id`          BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `user_id`     INT UNSIGNED        NULL,
    `user_name`   VARCHAR(120)    NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    `user_role`   VARCHAR(20)     NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    `action`      VARCHAR(60)     NOT NULL,
    `description` TEXT            NOT NULL,
    `created_at`  DATETIME        NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
    KEY `idx_created` (`created_at`),
    KEY `idx_user`    (`user_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

This is also saved as `storage/migration_add_activity_log.sql`. Fresh installs using `storage/inventory.sql` get the table automatically.

---

## My Borrows

The **My Borrows** page is visible to Borrowers only (not shown to Admin or IT Staff, who have the full Audit Log instead). It gives borrowers a self-service view of their account without needing to ask IT staff.

- **Currently Borrowing** — active checkouts with device name, type, shelf location, borrowed date, and due date. Overdue items are highlighted in red.
- **Borrow History** — all past transactions with return dates and who returned the device.

---

## Login

Staff sign in using their **employee QR code** (e.g. `ISA1-JAMJ`). There are two ways to sign in:

- **Camera scan** — the login page opens the camera automatically; hold up your employee ID card
- **Manual entry** — click **Enter code manually** and type your QR code, then press Enter

There are no shared passwords. Each employee's QR code is their credential. Admins manage employee records (including QR codes) from the Employees tab.

---

## Themes

The theme toggle button is in the top of the sidebar.

| Theme | How to activate | Icon shown |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------- |
| **Light** | Default | 🌙 (click to go dark) |
| **Dark** | Click the toggle once | ☀️ (click to go light) |
| **Pastel** | Click the toggle 5 times in a row | ✨ (click to return to light) |

Your preference is saved automatically and persists across all pages and sessions.

### Dark Mode Neon Effects

In dark mode, all cards, modals, stat cards, and the agency header have a subtle cyan neon edge glow. Nav items in the sidebar also glow and pulse on hover. These effects are dark mode only and do not appear in light or pastel mode.

### Pastel Mode (Easter Egg)

Clicking the theme button exactly 5 times (not necessarily all in the same direction — just 5 total clicks without landing on pastel) unlocks pastel mode, which applies a soft powder-blue, lilac, and ivory color palette. Click the ✨ button once to return to light mode. The click counter resets on page load, so pastel mode must be unlocked fresh each session (it does persist via `localStorage` across reloads once activated).

---

## Troubleshooting

**Page shows no styles**
The CSS path is not resolving. Confirm the `inventory` folder is placed directly inside `C:/xampp/htdocs/` and that XAMPP is running.

**404 on all pages except the homepage**
mod_rewrite is not enabled. See step 2 of [Installation](#installation).

**Database connection failed**
Make sure MySQL is running in the XAMPP Control Panel and that `inventory_db` exists in phpMyAdmin. Check credentials in `config/database.php`.

**Camera does not open on the login or scan page**
The browser requires HTTPS or `localhost` to allow camera access. Accessing the app via an IP address (e.g. `192.168.x.x`) on another device will block the camera — see the note below.

**Accessing from other devices on the network**
Camera access over a local IP requires HTTPS. The simplest option is to access the app only from the host machine (`localhost`), or set up a self-signed SSL certificate in XAMPP if network-wide access is needed.

**White screen after submitting a form**
Enable debug mode temporarily: open `config/app.php` and set `'debug' => true`. Reload the page to see the full error. Remember to set it back to `false` when done.

**OPcache serving stale pages after code changes**
Restart Apache from the XAMPP Control Panel to flush the bytecode cache. A hard browser refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R) alone is not enough when PHP files have changed.

**Theme preference doesn't persist (dark mode, pastel mode)**
Make sure the browser allows `localStorage`. Incognito/private mode may block it.

**CSS or JS not updating after changes**
Hard refresh with **Ctrl + Shift + R** to bypass the browser cache.

**Employee still shows active borrows after all devices returned**
This can happen if a device was manually set to Available before its transaction was closed. The active borrow count cross-checks against the device's actual status and corrects itself automatically on next page load.
